a node controlled by a profile. i.e. a private Node

'CAT'

Basically a list of keywords, doesnt exist on it's own

'(CAT)'
Model Library of Content Aggrigation Templates aka 'CATML'
(0,1,2,3,4)
(Node, Profile, Vault, Transfer, Tracker)
A browser that does not log data

'(CATPIC)'
Model Library of Content Aggrigation Templates with Profile Identity Contracts aka 'CATPICML'
(0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7)
(Node, Profile, Vault, Transfer, Tracker, Encryption, Second Encryption)
A browser that tags and logs data using public methods 

'@PIC'
Aggrication Template with Profile Identity Contracts
(3,4,5,6,7)
(Tags, MetaData, AI, Content, Power)
a tagged piece of data (portable)

@PIC++

(3,4,5,6,7,2,3)
(Tags, MetaData, AI, Content, Power, Random, Tags)

'PIC[]'
Profile Identity Contract with Black Box aka 'PICbox'
(5,6,7,1,0,-1,-2,-3)
(AI, Content, Power, Profile, Node, UI, Browser, Data)
Builder that creates encrypted blocks -- we don't know if the PIC is tagging the content correctly so we cannot assume it's a cat

[CAT,PIC]
Black Box Custom Aggrication Template with Profile Identity Contracts
(1,0,2,3,4,5,6,7)
(profile, node, navigation, content, stats, comments, replys, AI Moderation)
a profile website

[CAT,(PIC)]
Black Box Custom Aggrication Template with Model Libary of Profile Identity Contract 
(1,0,2,3,4,0,1,5,6,7)
(profile, node, bank, Skills, Quests, Node, Profile, Notes, Matter, Energy)
A private website with public features (comments, replys etc)
could be a metaverse controlled by a group that chooses your character for you
example:
    BOB DAO is a (CATPIC)
        its a (CATPIC) instead of a [CAT,PIC] because it's open source
    BOB DAO wants to hold a FischerRandom Chess Tournament and need a private place to hold the random Generator
        BOB DAO creates [CAT,(PIC)] and claims it to be bob's next iteration on (CATPIC)
        BOB DAO is required to post only (CATPIC)s as itterations because it is a DAO
        (PIC) is a public library inside a black box because the information recieved is controlled from outside of the box
            Contestants connect (with BOB's permission) to play chess through the (PIC)
    BOB DAO is required to post only (CATPIC)s as itterations because it is a DAO
        BOB DAO is now Both CATPICML and [CAT,(PIC)]
            C[ATP](IC)
            The content is BOBDAO's public node CATPICML
            the [AggrigationTemplateProfile] is in a box so it's hidden
            the Identity Contract Model Library 0167 contains possible combinations
            CATPICML[](IC)
        BOBDAO is claiming that their black box produces specific Identity Contracts
            Those IDs are given away as @PIC, Profile Identity contracts that update rank (aggrication template) over the course of the tournament
    After the tournament is over, an ATP[IC] (note not a [ATP] because only the contestants personal data is hidden in the black box) 
        any Model Library can run (CATPIC)[@PIC](ATP[IC])
            @PIC are possible winning combinations so although only the winner gets the combination, anyone can run through all possible combinations if they wanted to
            ATP[IC] is a list of winners were [IC] is the link to their identity
            CATPIC[@PIC]ATP[IC] tokens 

ATP[]
Aggrigation Template Profile Black Box
(3,4,5,1,0)
(Tags, MetaData, AI, UI, Data)
offline proccessing node that doesnt require internet. like a portable installation of an application. 

ATP[IC]
Aggrigation Template Profile with hidden Identity Contracts
(3,4,5,1,0,6,7)

C[ATP](IC)
Content that needs to be verified through identity contracts

TKSP@PIC
TIGER KINGDOM SPACE CAMP Aggregated Template Idenentiy Contract
TIGER
1. Timer Integrating Generative Executable Requests 
    Players generate NFTs by playing the game. The keywords are their data
    Completing the game gives the player TIGER@PIC
    A Tiger is a CAT that plays a game
KINGDOM
2. Keyword Identifiy New Gameplay Data Optimizations Marking 
    A Kingdom is a token owned by a TIGER that identified edge cases that were patched within the timer
    KINGDOM@PICs are transactions that fork the network
        KINGDOM@PICs 
SPACE
3. Spontanious Playthroughs After Collaborative Efforts
    (CATPIC)[@PIC](ATP[IC]) is an executable that marks all possible Playthroughs
    verification is like mining and rewards SPACE[@PIC]
    SPACE is a token awarded for hosting the game the @PIC is hidden because it can be run during the timer (or if there is no timer)
CAMP
4. Capitulated Aggressive Machine Protocal
    Create (CATPIC)s that offer guided playthoughs for verified playthoughs
    TIGER@PICs represent fractional ownership of CAMP@PICs
    KINGDOM@PICs
    SPACE[@PIC] 
    CAMPs that were never played offer (CATPIC)[@PIC](ATP[IC])
        ATP[IC] is a user playing the playthrough
        (CATPIC) stores times of people who complete the playthoughs
        (CATPIC)[@PIC] is awarded to fastest to complete it
            
            [@PIC] is their record proving they did it in that time.
            CAMP@PIC is awarded if they did it in the fastest
            (CATPIC)[@PIC] is not [] becuase
