The Following Tokens Control the structure of the DAO

The token structure of this DAO follows the spacetime protocal of the Community Utilization of Legal Tender for All Things (CULT@).

SPACE is an operational token. It is perminately collateralized through physical objects.
    Space records the physical location of an object. It is the token of the physical world.
TIME is a opertational token that reports the value of an object at any particular instance
    Time is a token relating to the value of an object. Time uses like referaces of physical objects to determine value.
SCTME is an instance of a token that is a function of the value of an object at a particular instance
    Space-time is fractionalized to represent the functional parts of an object at a particular instance in order to represent an action performed by or to that object.
    Effectively. Space-time tracks the use and wear of an object and determines a value.
