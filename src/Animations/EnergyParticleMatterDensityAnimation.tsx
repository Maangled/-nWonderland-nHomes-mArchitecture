// This animation is a demonstration for the Energy Browser
// the after the initial 5 contracts are loaded, the animation will show 5 Energy Models
// these energy models will be the 5 vaults of the host bank mPodel
// the first model will show the Bank Vault Note with the Second Vault as a subnote
// the second model will show the Web 3 Bank Vault Note with the Third Vault as a subnote
// the third model will show The user's personal Bank Vault Note with the Fourth Vault as a subnote
// the fourth model will show the Wonderland Bank Vault Note with the Fifth Vault as a subnote
// the fifth model will show the MetaVerse (DreamViewer) Bank Vault Note with the Sixth Vault as a subnote
// The animation wil  l show a beam of energy like a sine wave that pulses through the energy models showing the energy flow between the vaults
// The animation will show the energy flow from the Bank Vault Note to the Second Vault and so on
// the result wil!l be a helix of engergy passing information through the notes between the two vaults at each end
// after pulsing while the notes are being formed, the energy wave will pull the notes to the center of the screen
// The energy wave will be reprented by the energy browser Carousal
// The last lines to leave the screen will be two connecting threads that were the end of the energy wave
// both of the vaults and the energy browser will be shrunken and pulled up to the top of the screen
// the energy browser will lag behind a little and be pulled up via the threads
// the threads will slowly disappear completely as the models reach their final position in the Hud
