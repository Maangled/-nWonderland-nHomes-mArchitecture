The Dalai Lama School of Hero Protagonists.
The Hero Academy Factory
Introduction
This is a network for streamers to use open source AI to track their learning and productivity through the use of a web3 peer to peer trading platform with easy to use data privacy features.

The Dalai Lama School of Hero Protagonists does not actually exist. It is a template for creating self-sufficiency within home learning environments without losing the convenience new and advancing communicational technology offers.

The DALAI LAMA, DALI LLAMA Network is a standard so blockchain school systems can communicate with each other. 
DALAI stands for Decentralized Autogenerated Leveling Apparatus Iterations. 
LAMA stands for Leveraging Anonymous Machine Learning Algorithms 
DALI stands for Decentralized Autonomous Learning Institute
LLAMA stands for Learning Level Awards Marking Aptitude 

Decentralized - operating through a network of Nodes that contact each other through secure messaging channels hosted by it’s participants
Auto-generated - Programs that form themselves based on previous programs
Leveling - A way of earning accreditation through a game like system
Apparatus - The instrumentation you have at your disposal
Iterations - improving implementation of the instrumentation to create new educational journeys that you can share
Leveraging Anonymous Machine Algorithms - Even if someone doesn't have tools to learn things physically, this entire program is designed to be a lightweight Heads-Up Display that operates using a browser and a webcam that encrypts your data locally and then performs sequential ML algorithms that you agree to in advance to analyze that data through a decentralized network of trustless participants who do not have the ability to see the unencrypted data. This LAMA interface is important in securing the quality of the accreditation certificates (a skill based leveling system) without exposing sensitive information.  

Decentralized Autonomous Learning Institute - Modeled after a Decentralized Autonomous Organization the rules of our organization are written in contracted code and updated through a proposal based voting system that incentivises people to learn by giving them more voting control as they prove their understanding of the knowledge both to the communities they are a part of and AI algorithms. A collaborative quest to find truth and goodness in the vastness of space.

Learning Level Awards Marking Aptitude - this is an intrinsic descriptive token that represents a single achievement accomplished by a student. With minimum to how these tokens can be achieved, they can be used for something as simple as tracking how often you brush your teeth to how well you understand differential equations. As smart contracts that indirectly link your identity to the data that proves you accommodations said feat, the opportunities for exchanging good scientific inquiry and positive habit reinforcement are endless. 

The contract structure for these standards is explained in more detail in section 4.2
Hero Protagonist
Simply put, the central character is also an established force for good within the universe. The Hero Protagonist is also a source of Escapism; the audience sympathizes with the character because [that character]’s who they want to be, rather than who they actually are. It's common to see [Hero Protagonists] tackle villains who either cause or are personifications of real-life issues, in order to fulfill the desire of the audience to see these problems dealt with. - tvtropes.org[1]

A Hero Protagonist on planet Earth has to be dealing with how they are maintaining their digital life. The volume of information and resources available on youtube alone could rebuild the planet. We are proposing a system for quantizing the effect of your data, from your business connections down to your daily habits, in order to learn from and build off of. This system is a backbone to tokenizing your learning efforts in order to create a learning institution designed specifically for you and, should you choose, a Hero Academy named after you (or whatever name you pick) that teaches others or tackles problems too big for you to chew. You don't have to become a “Hero Protagonist” to make a school, and you don't have to stop using any service you are currently using unless you want to, but The Dalai Lama School of Hero Protagonists has a template for a DALAI DALI LAMA Llama Hero Protagonist Academy Node (e.i. a private host node) that ensures your data is always secured and includes a template for a Hero Protagonist UI system which creates a series of permission based profiles for you to create and monetize your content with different communities.

DALAI LAMA
	A node structure for submitting your homework to assignments anonymously you that you make up as you go along
DALI (school)
	A network that supports your good habits using awards that let you vote the structure of the network
Hero Protagonist Dao A Game that turns your browser into a learning environment that manages your data through an interactive and customizable UI overlay that presents you as the hero in a video game that follows your academic journeys through the metaverse and creates quests to help you find knowledge relevant to your ambitions.

The Dalai Lama name
The name Dalai Lama, although used here as an acronym that describes a way of unifying education through a low barrier-to-entry application, is the spiritual leader of the Tibetan People. As we enter into a new world of increasingly invasive technology, world powers seem incentivised to swing political narratives in their favor using analytical data. This societal engineering has caused massive distrust in our world leaders and divisions are being drawn both within and between our nations. These same tools that have before only been reserved for larger corporations with massive processing centers, are becoming more and more readily available to consumers. We as individuals and communities can find common strings that persist throughout all political sectors, religions, and educational systems to find the truth behind the meaning of our existence. We chose to use the symbol of the Dalai Lama to describe our first profile contract because the stability of our planet is at peril and specifically world powers are meddling in the selection of the succession of a line of people destined to bring peace. We want to help find the next Dalai Lama, or at a bare minimum be able to aggregate the love that exists between us despite our differences.

The idea of recognizing the Dalai Lama is that the spirit of all the people using the networks flows through this singular node and that node would be able to express a spiritual understanding of their data. This also allows for successive generations of Dalai Lama contracts that use different algorithms to represent the collective education of humanity. The DALI structure that the DALAI LAMA node is built on creates a fair voting system that represents knowledgeable opinions about facts. The algorithm that defines the DALAI LAMA will be a combination of the algorithms that people choose to use on their profiles (if they make that public) and algorithms chosen by people that have proven their knowledge and respect for the history of the Dalai Lama, Buddhism, and the Tibeten People. In the same way anyone could make their own profile that represents a school of thought centered on one persona and share that persona with the people who believe in their message. 

The goal of creating a Hero Academy using the DALI structure is slightly complicated and rather "meta." Although the term Hero Protagonist has a literary connotation and meaning, the idea of using it in such a manner came from a book called "Snowcrash"  that envisioned the metaverse well before it came to fruition. The protagonist of the story named himself Hiro Protagonist in the story's online metaverse while strapped for cash and living out of a storage unit. In the same way Wade Watts got the egg in Ready player one. We want every person to have the opportunity to be the Hero Protagonist regardless of their socioeconomic background.

The Hero Academy Network is designed to give good ideas legerage to getting started and blossom into decentralized societies that combine efforts to help save the planet. 

Example
Let's take the example of Alice, a retail coffee barista who can’t stop thinking about dairy farms as she prepares her orders. Alice sees that dairy farming has a significant impact on the climate and is in many ways very cruel to the dairy cows who provide the milk. Alice isn't fond of the milk alternatives on the market and decides she wants to create a milk substitute that copies the exact composition of milk: water, lactose, protein, fats, and vitamins in a lab setting without the use of animal labor. This task would seem daunting and nearly impossible, but through the power of communal efforts the project can be reconstructed in ways that don't require an expensive education and private laboratories. Alice first creates a proposal of what she wants to do. This does not mean a formal summary, but rather a building of interest through video, replies, papers and the beginning of content organization that would be useful in seeing her dream come true. This content is collected by Alice and used to create recommendations of seemingly related content and work timeline structures filled with games and videos that teach her new skills. With this content collection and a mission structure, Alice presents a quest to communities that would be interested in helping the missions succeed. This may be Alice's local community, her friends and family, or online communities that have similar goals in mind. Anyone in these communities can now invest in Alice and her mission by buying a tokenized piece of her collection. These tokenized pieces offer her investors a fair cut in a final model, but also offer a way for Alice to offer extra rewards like live streams, background videos or meetings. More importantly this creates a network where Alice is able to create bounties to conduct experiments that she may not have the time nor the equipment to perform. These bounties can range from answering one of the many questions she might have to performing a laboratory experiment to doing the entire project yourself, in your own way either online or in a digital space with a holographic projection of Alice after her work is completed. Whether Alice accomplishes what she set out to do is indeterminate by design. Hero Academies encourage people to accomplish lifelong feats that change the structure of humanity, but even if Alice has contributed a structured workflow that attempts to solve a complex problem that she or others can try again using different inputs from different communities until a solution arises. Alice has created a class structure consisting of research, presentation of knowledge and ideas with laboratory experimentation that calls on her community to help. This class structure can be taken up by other people built into a network of skilled participants. Lets say Alice accomplished her mission and devised an DIY way of making milk by simulating cow stomachs using a series of mason jars. Now others can learn to do the same and supply their local communities with her rendition of cruelty-free milk. This is the root of the DALI network, creating courses and studies that can be duplicated and worked on by anyone. 

Now take Bob, Bob is an aspiring chemist in a low-income neighborhood. Bob doesn't have the lab instrumentation to create milk in his backyard because maybe it requires a pressure cooker his family cannot afford. This doesn't dissuade Bob, because he doesn't actually want to make the milk, he just wants an understanding of the process so he can use that knowledge in another mission. Bob, through Alice's Hero Academy is able to follow along and take notes of the process and be awarded accommodations as acquires the knowledge that Alice is presenting. This reputation that Bob is building is given to him through the DALI process and is represented in Non-Transferable Tokens that only he can claim. But Bob wants a bit more of a structured approach to creating milk that he can use to represent his knowledge of laboratory apparatus (more 'official' than mason jars). Perhaps Bob is able to add a further explanation of the mechanisms that make up the process by connecting Alice's efforts to laboratory guidelines. Bob has created and fulfilled a bounty for Alice's project that did not exist when he started. Bob has now created a new Hero Academy that presents a new structure for achieving Alice's original goal while crediting Alice for her original work. There not always be a better way to do things but each of these students has created a game out of their learning process that others can build off of.

Non-DALI Agreement
We present the Dalai Lama as a smart contract that offers information to people when they don't have the resources or connections to build their own community. The Dalai Lama takes care of keeping the root of the network together by handling updates to the security infrastructure while any network built on top of it provides a digestible amount of data for the user to access. If someone wanted to build a school as a Decentralized Autonomous Learning Institute, all they would need to do is call on the Dalai Lama to connect them to the knowledge base. If anyone wants to learn something new, all they need to do is call on the Hero Protagonist that has collected that information from the Dalai Lama and displayed it in a way that helps them achieve their goals.

Both the Hero Protagonist and the Dalai Lama contracts are just that, contracts. The actual name of the contracts represent a plan to showcase the beauty of humanity. Anyone can not to encrypt their information while using the Dalai Lama Contract effectively posting it publicly. The Hero Protagonist Contract will showcase the projects that attempt to help the world and any individual Hero Academy might include it in their aggregated template.

Updates are always optional so you could easily just stop connecting to the network if you feel like your security has been breached but all of your data would still be secured locally or encrypted between your community.


mArchitecture Hero Academy

Introduction
mArchitecture Hero Academy is a blockchain technology company that focuses on data collection and analysis through the use of social media customization and promotion. The Academy is based on a peer to peer trading platform that uses machine learning to automate the dissemination of knowledge. This platform is designed to connect streamers, influencers, and viewers in a mutually beneficial way. Users can use various open-source AI tools to learn and track their progress in real-time, while interacting with each other on the platform.

The goal of the academy is to connect streamers and viewers directly, allowing people to learn from each other in a way which develops a strong community that encourages growth and long term relationships between all parties. The goal of the Academy is to bring about a new age of education where peer to peer learning makes possible what once seemed unattainable: a completely free system that accurately rewards participants based on individual contributions by providing an accessibility focused virtual assistant platform that is built from the bottom up by each student, learning as they do while being secured using advanced cryptographic techniques and biometric signatures.

Generally, this social media platform is designed to help streamers teach each other and be more productive in their chosen fields. Through Machine Learning, there are no restrictions on what knowledge you can acquire—nearly all of it will be readily available for you when you need it.

Hero Academies use a multisig authority to create a secure and catered network to its users. The first authority is granted to the Dalai Lama contract, a series of smart contract proxies used to encrypt and secure information on public ledgers. The second Authority is the Hero Protagonist, the person who participates in the network who will be henceforth referred to as the Student. They are given full authority over access to data they create. 

The reason for this division is so the student can keep their data private while accessing a public informational network. The connection where the student accesses the public record of information is visible by default to the decentralized network that hosts the contracts (chains such as ETH or BTC) so in order to prevent the student from being tracked every time the receive information, they can access it indirectly through Content Aggregation Templates (CATs) where the access record and personal information shared is agreed upon beforehand through a data contract called a Profile Identification Contract (PIC). Using this CAT PIC system, data can be accessed and acted upon while giving all involved parties due credit for their efforts while attempting to minimize harmful actors such as trolls, doxxers, and scams through a smaller dataset that is more easily moderated. All data accessed at the user's endpoint can then be categorized into a CAT that represents them. A data block containing their history and personal information that is built on a system of interconnecting blocks of information that are constantly being arranged for them in new and novel ways. Furthermore, a Hero can authorize others to use the connections they made by sharing PICs that are a snippet of their data pertaining to specific research or work. Think of it this way, Charlie takes notes on a video lecture of Bob discussing the chemistry of milk. Charlie has created a CAT using Bob’s Pic that now contains an extra layer of human information processing. Charlie thinks his notes are pretty good and wants his public profile to reflect that, however, Charlie wasn't wearing pants when he took the notes. Charlie can release a PIC of his cat that contains Bob video (or reference to the PIC contract he connected to it with), Charlie's notes, and an encrypted video of him taking the notes. The video (although encrypted) contains valuable information about his decisions while taking the notes. This CATPIC Charlie has created is part of a decentralized game to take the best notes using Bob's video. This game is moderated using AI that analyzes videos of people taking notes while watching Bob’s video and begins when bob releases the video. Using Fully Homomorphic Encryption techniques, Charlie's CATPIC can be compared to others who have taken notes using Bob's video and given a note score skill that has proof Charlie was the actor who took the notes without ever revealing the fact that Charlie was in his underwear the whole time. By definition this game is competitive because it uses an MVP style system to categorize notes and note taking skills, but Charlie never has to reveal any personal information and it doesn't matter how he does because he will be given valuable feedback to help him improve how he takes notes. Furthermore, if Charlie, takes the notes of a certain quality in a particular amount of time, or uses a novel technique he can be awarded achievements that are claimable through an anonymous retrieval system. 

This system benefits from a great deal of self incentivization for the modular hosting of instructional games. Bob wants to host his own video but may be overloaded with requests if enough people access his content. If Alice approves of Bob's additions to her work, Alice may choose to host the work herself because Bob's work contains her work and may bring a new group of users to her academy. Charlie is also incentivized to host Bob's work (or at least part of it) because it will allow more people to submit notes themselves and improve the precision and accuracy of the information that Charlie receives from the network or through contract, Charlie can allow others to process his data package through contract with him when they need to prove Charlie has the knowledge to do something he is requesting to do. Practically speaking, a token is what represents your pathway through a game and your real world learning experience can be hosted as a node that acts as both a vote and a resource in the presentation of that knowledge.

Enter mArchitecture. mArchitecture is an architectural metaverse firm with the intention of creating a decentralized network of people that are passionate about augmented reality.  mArchitecture is a traditional architecture firm that specializes in the creation of Augmented Reality live/work studios. These studios are designed to be connected virtually using a home hardware verification system based on the DALI standard. This firm is being established with a number of goals.
	1. Demonstrate how to create a personal brand can be created through the DALI network and scaled into a business.
	2. Demonstrate AI can enhance learning
	3. Demonstrate how secure networks can be set up at home using open source software and consumer-grade hardware
	4. To develop project standards for community investment
	5. To develop and maintain the DL and HP while preparing them for public proposal deployment

mAchitecture is being formed to show how a brand company can transition into a DAO by releasing guided learning adventures that reward you with projects that can actually come to fruition both in real life and in the metaverse. It is being formed as a traditional firm because it is hard to know how a decentralized learning environment will scale, including dealing with regulatory restraints in certain industries
To prevent the company from doing a 'rug pull' control over its assets will be handled by a multisig wallet connected to DLHP nodes of the principals of the firm. These will include Architects, other Architecture & Engineering Firms, Security Specialists, Lawyers and a group of subscribers who have 'beta' access to the network. During this time the contracts that launch the full version of the network will be updated through rapid prototyping to create a viable pathway on how to scale to a broader audience with a lower potential for failure. mArchitecture offices will be created using digital twin machine designs that verifies the security of data transmission between hosts. Non-fungible tokens will be created that represent the services they offer and aspiring architects will be able to work directly with professionals using secure platforms that track their performance through AI analytics that reward them credit in their understanding of building systems all while releasing Non-Fungible Tokens of Building Information Models that are checked by professionals (and algorithms) to assess their accuracy pertaining to the law and building code in order to keep people safe.

This is how mArchitecture is going to be using the DALI Network: as a Decentralized Proof of Authority. Architects wield a tremendous deal of power in influencing the way our society functions. From home building to city planning, architects realize societal visions into concrete infrastructure, but these dreams have been broadcast in the shadow of ensuring corporate success creating an autocratic meritocracy where good designs go to the companies that can afford them. It's time that everyday homes had the design influence of professionals while fulfilling the dreams and aspirations of regular everyday people. Problems we face can be worked on by any individual feeling creative and a network of trained professionals who can be in more than one place at a time.

“Marchitecture is a portmanteau of the words marketing and architecture.” Wikipedia Martech, a Marketing Technology platform had this to say: "Marchitecture is a very pragmatic way to align and map the features of your product to the needs of the customer and marketplace by showcasing how your technology solves real business problems that customers are trying to solve — think of it as a blueprint."  Here we generate a portmanteau of that word Marchitecture, the acronym for the term Augmented Reality and the planet named after the roman god of war.
mArschitecture: The Metaverse Augmented Reality Mars-bound Architecture Hero Academy. 
We specialize in creating homes for people that are connected through a trustless network of voluntary participants in quests that utilize sustainable renovation and preservation efforts that makes learning at home more fun and explorative while accelerating the advancement of modular building and construction techniques through community based experimental bounties.

Because the firm is based on a decentralized network security platform connecting offices using digital twin architecture that secures a data network performing analysis using local machine learning and fully homomorphic encrypted server-side deep learning, we will be creating homes that are both a part of learning networks and are learning apparatus in and of themselves. We are calling these homes nHomes because there could be any number of homes participating in the network at any given time.


Establishing the first user account as a private profile is important to showcase the ability to create encrypted content and AI Analysis over public ledger infrastructure. Anonymity on the internet is incredibly important for multiple reasons. 
1. Using anonymous accounts creates a barrier between you and people who could abuse your privacy. 
2. Anonymity opens doors for people who have anxiety disorders or are nervous about venturing out of their comfort zones
3. Whistle blowers and freedom of speech necessities.
 
With the rise of vTubers and more and more sophisticated renderings of human like computers taking over the internet, there will be a need for linking real human identity to the anonymously to the online personas they inhabit and the activity they do online, but that doesn't mean we should have to give up our rights to privacy to do it. Linking tokens to earn credits on identity dependent accounts can be done later, verification can be done well after the fact and anonymously. 

Summation
If someone were applying for for a job, and the employer needed to verify a minimum level of education, they could run your tokens that represent the work you have done through an online school system and have smart contracts and AI that represents their company verify that it was actually you who did the work and to what accuracy your portrayed skills are. The layer of this complex arrangement of smart contracts that links your personal identity never has to be made public and neither does your actual data. The amount of information that your employer actually needs is a meta analysis of your ability to do the job. The categorization and verification of identity that awards these credits goes through a smart contract system called a Decentralized Autonomous Learning Institute (DALI) . This is an educational standard focused on understanding and categorizing knowledge by Learning Level Algorithmic Media Assets (LLAMA) , a definitive way to credit accomplishments. These media assets are upgradable smart contracts tokens that create metadata analysis based on a game-like achievement system where your data is analyzed and then stored on the blockchain as a credit. The more data you provide proving you read something or learned something and how you applied the knowledge or made credits, the more credits you receive. The more AI and Machine learning algorithms that are built through quests posted to bounty boards, the more tokens you earn verifying your achievements.  

Something, Something

Decentralized Autogenerated Leveling Apparatus Iterations Leveraging AI and ML Algorithms 

The DALAI LAMA DALI LLAMA NODE's mission and purpose is to provide a safe space for adults and children to learn and express their ideas and opinions while one day hoping to find the next Dalai Lama through analytics and games.

The name itself does not mean much, if anything to the end user except to represent how all of your information is stored. You create a node with your actual identity and then make an identity as a node that only shares the information you want to be shared publicly. It’s essentially the idea that a cat is something in real life that can do any number of unpredictable things in real life and a picture of that cat is a snapshot into the cat’s world in that moment in time. MarsR chitecture offers a platform to track a cat's entire life using cameras and share snippets of their adventures as 3d digital tokens that prove how good that cat is at scratching things and offering bounties to build homes designed to nurture the cat’s good habits and curiosities.


Decentralized Autonomous Learning Institute 

A [[DALI Contract System]] is an online digital network with a structure of a DAO that focuses specifically on education

Learning Level Algorithmic Media Assests

[[Learning]] are tokens awarded for reaching new personal goals

 The Dalai Lama is a Dali that uses Llamas

  

The quest system is designed like a game, a race to create notes that help to better explain the world around us. Some people are better note takers than other and that doesn't really matter, what does is that there are millions of connections and investments in education that still need to be found and solidified and the the best way to do it is through a game that awards [[Note Skill]] points

  

The Hero Academy network is a school designed to make learning cheap and easy and creates a base structure for anyone to start their own academy using [[quests]] that lead people to knowledge or even just categorize their own learning. The Hero Academy is just one way of creating a profile system that helps design quests as if you were the hero protagonist in a video game.

  

The [[Buddha Quest]] is the first quest in the academy that takes you through an adventure creating your own node profile, online or private.

  

During the Buddha Quest you are able to choose your own [[Profile Contract System]] that specifices that available learning aparatus you deploy. e.i. the UI and the Content Network.  This is the total extent of the Dalai Lama contract as it allows anyone to be free to create a network with terms and agreements of their choosing.

  

The Profile System specific to the [[Hero Protagonist DALI Node]] is known as a [[CAT]] (CAT) CATs are contracts that house and store the information a Hero views and the Data created on how they use it. The HPDALI creates a [[PIC]] (PIC) every time the person requests information from a source or uses data from their CAT on a [[SaaS]] connection.
this could include liking or commenting
collaborating online
purchaces
"but what if someone is buying bomb parts? doesn't the gov't need to know these things" possibly, but that can be done through open source data collection based on a democratic process. Even if you do buy bomb parts, you need to be able to have the ability to rationalized your purchaces before your identity is ever exposed. ONLY when there is algorithmic proof without a reasonable doubt should your identity be exposed.
scientific data pursuits (using your data to understand global health issues, etc)

Anyone can submit work to the Hero Protagonist DALI's. Main G will appear private but it's actually the location anyone publicly submits content to, they can also see all of the content as everything that HPdao does must be public, but no sorting or data analysis happens at the main G level. All transactions that are deemed non dangerous make it to HPdao. You can always see why HPdao approved or disaproved content by going thorough the Main G profile. Censorship is obviously an issue which is why the HPdao is built on top of the Dali Lama smart contract. Anyone can create their own academy type system that analysis public work so even if HPdao were to get compromised and start approving or denying things based on a political agenda, it can be rebuilt from the ground up using the summaries of the previous incarnation as record. In order to avoid this Hero Protagonist Dao is built with safeguards including guardians, question and answer, funding voting allotments and merit based educational voting systems.

In Summary:

DALAI LAMA DALI Node - blockchain categorization of learning
Buddha Quest - Create your own profile
Hero Protagonist - a profile that is actually a collective of profiles.
Hero Academy - A profile with an expansion for hero quests from
Main G - A random profile on the blockchain
Main G Hero Academy - an actual node that holds both Main G's "private" profile and the Hero Academy Standard.
mARchitecture Hero Academy - an Architecture firm started to blur the lines between work, live, and educational spaces based on a modular home design
