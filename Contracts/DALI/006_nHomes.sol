// nHomes (nH) v1.0.0
// this contract is a proxy to the profile contract
// this contract is called by a conda enviornment running on a user's computer to create a household node as a profile.
// this node can hold multiple profiles while keeping the profiles private, and the household node public
// this node can also hold multiple homes as offices, and each home can hold multiple profiles to be used in professional settings
// nodes are used to create profiles
// profiles can be made in a number of ways
    // profiles can be generated by a user's computer, phone, or tablet
    // profiles can be generated automatically by a home or professional node (this is the default) and locked to the user's biometrics
        // in this case, the data from the profile is encrypted and stored locally on the node's computer.
        // this contract can use non-detirministic algorithms to generate a signiture key. using Phoenix these keys can be uploaded to the blockchain to give the user access to their profile
            // this can allow for time delayed access to the data, giving the user time to recover their profile before it is deleted
            // this can also allow for the user to recover their profile if they lose their phone or computer

// it has a function to create a profile node
// it has a function to create a profile node fragment
